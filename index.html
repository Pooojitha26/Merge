                If you prefer learning by reading, you should consider investing in JavaScript books. These can be your main source of learning, or they can be great as supplementary learning material.

                Books are a great source of in-depth JavaScript knowledge, and they are often authored by industry experts with years of experience.

                Coding boot camps provide a structured approach to learning JavaScript from scratch. They put you on a schedule and force you to learn a lot in a short period of time. 

                Learning on your own is great. But sometimes, it is hard to keep yourself accountable.
